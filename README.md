# Rick and Morty Project

### An exercise project where I get information from a server
### And I will show it in the list of characters
### By clicking on the button, it will show information about the character in the character details section
### These icons are imported from Heroicons
### And everything on this page is related
### The number of all characters received from the API is shown in the Navbar and in the SearchResult section
### You can search the character
### Even in the character details section, there is a button to add to Favorites, and by clicking on the button, it will show you a text, it will not allow you to select it.
### And it will be added to the Favorites section and its number will be shown in the corner of the heart
### You can click on the heart and a Modal will open for you, where you can delete items from the Favorites section
### And the information is stored in the user's local storage
### But because I get the information from an external server, the internet must be turned on
### And I put a loading page for the user to see that the information is loading
### Fetching data with axios and async await
### Toaster is used to show the errors
### Use the cleanup function
